OS Assignment – Process Execution with fork and exec

Overview:
This project is part of an Operating Systems course.
The task was to implement a program (loopcmp) that can run other comparison programs dynamically — without containing their logic directly in its own source code.
Unlike a previous version of this assignment (which supported only 3 built-in comparison methods), this implementation allows running any comparison program provided by the user at runtime, without recompiling.
The main program is launched once from the terminal, and it handles running all required comparisons.

Environment & Compilation:
Operating System: Linux
Implementation: Written from scratch based on course materials and textbook examples.
Compilation: Done manually using a custom Makefile.
